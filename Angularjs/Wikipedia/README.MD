# Wikipedia Search With AngularJS #


This module is mainly for Wikipedia search functionality by using the angular script.


We have used a different module like ui.bootstrap, autocomplete for search, en.wikipedia.org/w/api to get the search data and controller to search on click from the module and you can navigate different result there on typing.

We have used latest tooltip method on hover search result to display its content there and when you click on result data also you will redirect to the related wiki page from there directly.

It’s very simple to use and navigate for any user interface purpose.
